\section{Background and Motivation}

\section{Goals and Aims}

- develop lightweight tool that has few requirements to gain insight to data movements in a PCIe link

\section{Delimitation}

- Heterogeneous systems have many different interconnects
- Focus on PCIE-interface in this thesis
- (why)? not sure yet, figure something out

\section{Structure and Approach}

- three approaches / benchmarks
- bandwidth: for measuring the raw bandwidth capacity of the system
- nvml: for measuring pcie link activity
- copy: for measuring pcie link activity
