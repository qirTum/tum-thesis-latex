\chapter{NVML Counters}\label{chapter:nvml}

\section{Concept}

\begin{itemize}
	\item - nvidia has hardware counters, accessible via nvml library
	\item - counters measure average bandwidth over the last 20ms, in kb/sec
	\item - Transmit and Receive have seperate counters
\end{itemize}


\section{Implementation}
\begin{itemize}
	\item - method call to read counters takes about 20ms
	\item - to increase data granularity and measurement consistency, measuring of TX and RX was done in parallel
\end{itemize}



\section{Results}

- graphs and discussing the graphs

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{successes}
\begin{itemize}
	\item - measures bandwidths accurately to some degree
	\item - introduces little overhead (probably, still to be measured)
	\item - does not require any modifications to software
\end{itemize}

\subsection{shortcomings}
\begin{itemize}
	\item - granularity of method calls prevent more accurate readings -> short memory transfers may be not detected
	\item - black box approach of nvidia's source code doesn't allow for proper sanity-checking
	\item - for more accurate readings and measurements: timestamping of original program -> modification
\end{itemize}
