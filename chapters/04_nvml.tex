\chapter{NVML Counters}\label{chapter:nvml}

\section{Concept}
- nvidia has hardware counters, accessible via nvml library
- counters measure average bandwidth over the last 20ms, in kb/sec
- Transmit and Receive have seperate counters

\section{Implementation}
- method call to read counters takes about 20ms
- to increase data granularity and measurement consistency, measuring of TX and RX was done in parallel



\section{Results}

- graphs

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{successes}

- measures bandwidths accurately to some degree
- introduces little overhead (probably, still to be measured)


\subsection{shortcomings}
- granularity of method calls prevent more accurate readings -> short memory transfers may be not detected
- black box approach of nvidia's source code doesn't allow for proper sanity-checking
