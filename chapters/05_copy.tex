\chapter{Link Saturation}\label{chapter:copy}

\section{Concept}
\begin{itemize}
	\item - if bandwidth is saturated, copy operations should slow down
	\item - full duplex, so HtoD and DtoH both need measuring
\end{itemize}

\section{Implementation}

\begin{itemize}
	\item - Started as a thread that just continuously monitored the counters for set duration of time and printed output into console
	\item - Added wrapper and file output in subsequent versions to simplify data-gathering
	\item - Added chunk size options for the buffer copy chunks to get as little overhead as possible while getting most consistent data gathering
	\item - Delays are measured, no clear correlation between delay and bandwidth
	\item - Overhead yet to be properly assessed, however, introduces somewhat significant overhead. TODO: ASSESS OVERHEAD
	\item - Measure transmit and receive in the same thread, sequentially
\end{itemize}


\section{Results}


- graphs\\
- descriptors of graphs

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{successes}
\begin{itemize}
	\item - gives somewhat detailed going-on about PCIe link activities
	\item - more accurate than nvml counters -> global discussion?
\end{itemize}
\subsection{shortcomings}
\begin{itemize}
	\item - introduces significant overhead due to occupying PCIe link
	\item - Delay compensation sometimes leads to negative values due to delay inconsistencies
\end{itemize}
