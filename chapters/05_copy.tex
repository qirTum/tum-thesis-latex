\chapter{Link Saturation}\label{chapter:copy}

\section{Concept}
- if bandwidth is saturated, copy operations should slow down
- full duplex, so HtoD and DtoH both need measuring

\section{Implementation}

- Started as a thread that just continuously monitored the counters for set duration of time and printed output into console
- Added wrapper and file output in subsequent versions to simplify data-gathering
- Added chunk size options for the buffer copy chunks to get as little overhead as possible while getting most consistent data gathering
- Delays are measured, no clear correlation between delay and bandwidth
- Overhead yet to be properly assessed, however, introduces somewhat significant overhead. TODO: ASSESS OVERHEAD
- Measure transmit and receive in the same thread, sequentially

\section{Results}

- graphs
- descriptors of graphs

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{successes}
- gives somewhat detailed going-on about PCIe link activities
\subsection{shortcomings}
- introduces some overhead due to occupying PCIe link
- Delay compensation sometimes leads to negative values due to delay inconsistencies
